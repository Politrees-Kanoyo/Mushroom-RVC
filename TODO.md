# PolGen TO-DO List

---

I acknowledge that there have been some mistakes while working with the repository and the code. I am currently focused on addressing these issues and enhancing the program. Below are my plans for the near future:

## TODO:

1. **Translate the Code to English**: Ensure all code comments and documentation are in English for better accessibility.
2. **Implement Internationalization (i18n)**: Translate the user interface into multiple languages to cater to a global audience.
3. **Add Batch Conversion Support**: Enable the processing of multiple files in a single operation to improve efficiency.
4. **Rewrite the README File**: Update the README to provide clearer instructions and better documentation.
5. **Add Function Documentation**: Ensure all functions are well-documented to improve code understandability and maintainability.
6. **Organize the Codebase**: Refactor the code to improve structure and maintainability.
7. **Simplify Output Logic**: Streamline the output processes to make the program more user-friendly.
8. **Create a Package**: Develop a package to allow the project to be used as a library, enhancing its usability and integration capabilities.
9. **Update RVC Algorithms**: Improve the RVC algorithms to support various vocoders, similar to Applio.
10. **Achieve Full Automation**: Ensure complete automation of the process for easy and convenient generation of AI covers.

This list is not exhaustive and may be expanded in the future.

## Completed:

- ~**Track Separation**: Added the ability to separate a track into vocals and instrumental components.~
