# PolGen TO-DO list

---

Yes, I made some mistakes while working with the repository and the code. Currently, I am actively engaged in fixing these issues and improving the program. Here are my plans for the near future:

# TODO:

- Translate the code to English.
- Translate the interface into different languages using i18n.
- Add support for batch conversion.
- Add the ability to separate a track into vocals and instrumental.
- Rewrite the README file.
- Organize the code more effectively.
- Simplify the output logic.
- Create a package to use the project as a library.

This is just a small list for now, but in the future, I may add more to it.
